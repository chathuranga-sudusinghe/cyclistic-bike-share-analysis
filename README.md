## 🧹 Data Cleaning Summary

The following steps were performed:

- ✅ Merged 3 large datasets (2022–2024)
- ✅ Handled over **4 million missing station values** safely using `"Unknown"`
- ✅ Converted `started_at` and `ended_at` to proper datetime format
- ✅ Verified:
  - No duplicate Ride IDs
  - No negative or zero ride durations
  - No null datetime values
- ✅ Created a **single MASTER CLEAN dataset (2GB)**

Final output:

---

## 📈 Key Business Questions (Planned Analysis)

- How do **casual vs member riders** differ in usage behavior?
- What are the **most popular stations**?
- Which **time of day and season** has peak demand?
- How does **ride duration vary** by rider type and bike type?
- What are the **growth trends across years**?

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard (Coming Soon)

The final dashboard will include:

- Total rides & ride duration KPIs
- Member vs Casual comparison
- Hourly & monthly trends
- Top start & end stations
- Bike type usage analysis
- Geographic ride distribution (Map)

---

## 🗄️ SQL Analysis (Coming Soon)

This project will also include:

- SQL database creation
- Business-level queries
- Performance-optimized aggregations
- View & index usage
